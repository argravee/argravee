## Hey there 👋

I'm Nasar a Computer Science & Philsosphy student at the University of Saskatchewan

I enjoy building tools that really help people especially in areas where where problems are well understood but progress is constrained by institutional, political, and administrative complexity/inaction. I also love challenging myself with technically demanding and abstract systems.
