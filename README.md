## Hey there 👋

I'm Nasar, an undergrad student in Computer Science & Philsosphy at the University of Saskatchewan.

I enjoy building tools that truly help people especially in areas where progress is constrained by institutional, political, and administrative complexity/inaction. I also love challenging myself with technically demanding and abstract systems.


## 🔧 What I’m currently working on

* Backend and systems-focused projects (APIs, data models, correctness, protocols)
* Methods for semantic comparison of quantum circuits to support fair benchmarking and reproducibility.
* Developing NLP-based tools for administrative decision support
* Fullstack web-applications for nonprofit organizations
